// Write a program that calculates the remaining balance on a loan after the
// first, second, and third monthly payments: e.g.
//      Enter amount of loan: 20000.00
//      Enter interest rate: 6.0
//      Enter monthly payment: 386.66
//
//      Balance remaining after first payment: $19713.34
//      Balance remaining after second payment: $19425.25
//      Balance remaining after third payment: $19135.71
//      Display each balance with two digits after the decimal point.
// Hint: Each month the balance is decreased by the amount of the payment,
// but increased by the balance times the monthly interest rate. To find
// the monthly interest rate, convert the interest rate entered by the user
// to a percentage and divide it by 12.
