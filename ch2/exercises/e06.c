Why is it not a good idea for an identifer to contain more than one adjacent
underscore (as in current___balance, for example)?

This is not advise because in some fonts the number of underscores can be
difficult to read. Additionally, some standards include special naming
conventions including number of underlines to classify special functions in c.
