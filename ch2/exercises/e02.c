/*
Consider the following program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}

Identify the directives and statements in this program:
    Directives:
        #include <stdio.h>
    Statements:
        printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
        printf("fill the time\n");
        printf("available for its completion.\n");
        return 0;

What output does the program produce?
